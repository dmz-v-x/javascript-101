## Introduction to JavaScript

### 1. What is a programming language?

A **programming language** is a way to tell a computer what to do.

You write instructions.
The computer follows them.
Something useful happens.

**Mental model:**

- Human → writes instructions  
- Computer → executes instructions

### 2. Different types of programming languages

#### a) Low-level vs High-level

- Low-level: closer to machine (Assembly, C)
- High-level: closer to humans (JavaScript, Python)

---

#### b) Procedural / Imperative

- Code runs step by step
- “Do this, then that”

---

#### c) Object-Oriented (OOP)

- Code organized around objects
- Objects = data + behavior
- JavaScript supports OOP in its own way

---

#### d) Functional

- Focus on functions
- Avoids changing data directly
- JavaScript supports functional patterns

---

#### e) Scripting languages

- Used for automation and quick tasks
- JavaScript is also a scripting language

> One language can belong to multiple categories.

---

### 3. Compiled vs Interpreted languages

#### Compiled languages

- Code is converted before running
- Usually faster
- Example idea: write → compile → run

---

#### Interpreted languages

- Code runs line by line
- No separate compile step

---

#### Important reality

Modern languages mix both ideas.

JavaScript:
- Interpreted
- Also JIT-compiled by engines

So this distinction is a **learning model**, not a strict rule.

---

### 4. What is JavaScript?

**JavaScript** is a programming language used to make web pages interactive.

- Runs in browsers
- Runs on servers (Node.js)
- Controls behavior

Example (browser console):

    console.log("Hello from JavaScript!");

---

### 5. Core ideas of JavaScript

#### a) Dynamic typing

Variables don’t have fixed types.

    let x = 5;
    x = "hello";

---

#### b) First-class functions

Functions can be stored, passed, and returned like values.

---

#### c) Prototype-based objects

JavaScript uses prototypes instead of classical inheritance.

---

#### d) Single-threaded but asynchronous

- One main thread
- Handles async work using the event loop

---

#### e) Event-driven

JavaScript reacts to:
- clicks
- input
- network responses

---

### 6. How JavaScript differs from other languages

- Runs natively in browsers
- Uses prototypes
- Dynamically typed
- Event-loop based async model

---

### 7. Why use JavaScript?

- Works everywhere
- Frontend + backend
- Huge ecosystem
- Fast feedback
- Beginner-friendly start

---

### 8. Real-world use cases

- Interactive websites
- Backend APIs
- Mobile apps
- Desktop apps
- Automation scripts
- Games
- Developer tools

---

### 9. What type of language JavaScript is?

- High-level
- Dynamically typed
- Multi-paradigm
- Interpreted + JIT compiled
- Weakly typed
